# StockFighter

Project for playing the programming game at https://www.stockfighter.io/

The StockFighter.Api project provides an F# API to the game's HTTP and websockets APIs. There is at least one other F# API for the game on GitHub already, but I felt writing my own was a better way to get started with the game.

The StockFighter.Solutions project may contain spoilers if you want to play the game yourself.
